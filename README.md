# Homework_1_ADM
The results of the first homework of the  ADM course 2023/2024 are based on 3 main files:
- HW1_ADM.ipynp: this file contains the codes used to solve the exercises, the cases in which the solution has been checked online are specified by a small message inside the backets close to the exercise's name, these messages say: the solution has been seen online; the cases in which the exercise hasn't been done are specified by a message close to the exercise's title that says "not done"
- Submission_Hackerrank.pdf: this file contains the list of the submitted exercises
- aws_1: this file contains the screens of the results of the knowledge check for the AWS modules (1,2,3,4,7,13 and 14), unfortunately I had to take the screens because i couldn't see the reults on the "Grades" section on the web page
